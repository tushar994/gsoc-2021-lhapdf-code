# What is this?

This is a repository that contains the code that I wrote during my GSOC-2021 project for lhapdf that wasn't pushed to the repository. It contains code to generate datasets for my analytic function, code to plot graphs and measure accuracy of the interpolators, and the code for the interpolators themselves.
